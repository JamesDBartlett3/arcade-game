## Gameplay Instructions
The object of the game is to move your player avatar from the grassy area, across the cobblestone road, to the river, **without** colliding with any of the "enemy" avatars (which _currently_ look like a cross between a ladybug and a cockroach). If you collide with an enemy (or one of them collides with you), _you will lose one bar of health,_ your avatar will be sent back to the grassy area, and you can try again. Each time you make it to the river, you will be shown a congratulations message _and your score will increase._  
_If you lose all of your health bars, the game is over, and your final score will be displayed._

Move your avatar around the board using any of the following input methods:
* Arrow Keys (Up/Down/Left/Right)
* Doom/Quake keymap style (WASD)
* _Touchscreen swipe_

## How To Download And Modify The Source Code
If you would like to download and/or modify this game's source code, please feel free!  
Here are a few suggested methods:
* [Download it (as a ZIP file)!](https://github.com/JamesDBartlett3/arcade-game/archive/master.zip) (easiest & simplest method)
* Clone it! (still fairly straightforward, but may require some software installation & configuration)
  * [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (a beginner-friendly UI for GitHub).
  * Run [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) or [SVN](https://help.github.com/articles/support-for-subversion-clients/) directly from the command line (for more experienced users and software developers).
* [Fork it!](https://github.com/JamesDBartlett3/arcade-game/fork/) (requires a GitHub account)
  * Please note that this is a proof-of-concept project, so while I certainly encourage you to fork and play around with the code in this repo, I will not be accepting pull requests at this time. That being said, I **will** be keeping an eye on any forks that pop up, and if I see you doing something really cool, I might just get in touch with you.
